#	Express MongoDB Starting Template 	#

This is a simple starting point for a MongoDB Express application, and primarily includes things I have found myself implementing over and over again on every project.
Besides MongoDB and Express, this template also includes authentication, done with **[bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)** & **[JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)**.
